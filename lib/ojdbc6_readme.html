<h2>Upgrading from ojdbc14.jar to ojdbc6.jar</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
Conventionally, ojdbc14.jar is used as a thin driver to connect to Oracle. But Oracle recommends ojdbc6.jar instead if the JVM platform
is Java 6 (c.f. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/jdbc-faq-090281.html#02_02), specifically:
<p>
"...ojdbc6.jar
All the classes to support basic functionality for the Thin and OCI drivers when using JDK 1.6 (JSE 6). Additional jar files are required when you use some features...."
<p>

The upgrade related to the Curation Tool (thereafter simply known as CDECURATE) is necessary to fix "???" issue (c.f. https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=518411) in a column which is of STRUCT data type.

<h3>Approach</h3>
Generally the upgrade does not require any code change, if standard Java SQL is used (i.e. java.sql.*). However, we didn't manage to fix the issue in our environment without resorting
to Oracle specific implementations of the JDBC classes.
<p>
Those packages that we used to fix "???" issue were:

import oracle.sql.Datum;
import oracle.sql.STRUCT;

These packages have a corresponding packages in standard packages (java.sql.*) but we didn't have enough time/resource to look into the root cause of why they didn't work in our environment.
It is recommended that in the future upgrade of the JDBC driver, more research/test should be carried out so that the application could use the standard Java SQL packages, instead of using 
the Oracle packages/classes.
<p>
A sample test class is available <a href="https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/WebSVN/filedetails.php?repname=cdecurate&path=%2Ftrunk%2Fsrc%2Fgov%2Fnih%2Fnci%2Fcadsr%2Fcdecurate%2Ftest%2FTestSpreadsheetDownload.java">here</a>, which allow us to confirm/demonstrate the issue quickly.
<p>
The real codes used by CDECURATE is in CustomDownloadServlet.java. Our deployed application server was JBoss 5.1.0 GA when this readme text was prepared.
