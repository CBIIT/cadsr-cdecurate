To install the tools, before running runall.cmd / runall.sh:

npm install

Alternatively, one can install it manually:

npm install -g qunit

npm install -g jasmine-node

npm install -g phantomjs

npm install -g instanbul

Note: You need to have NodeJS with npm installed. Alternatively, you can also install the above three tools with other tools like brew or bower.
