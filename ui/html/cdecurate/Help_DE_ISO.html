            ISO (International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission) 
            form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. ISO/IEC 11179 describes the standardizing and registering of 
            data elements to make data understandable and shareable. <br><br>
            The purpose of ISO/IEC 11179 is to give concrete guidance on the formulation and maintenance of discrete data element 
            descriptions and semantic content (metadata) that shall be used to formulate data elements in a consistent,
            standard manner.

            Humans are aware of anything that exists in the natural world through its properties. Data represents the 
            properties of these things. A data element is a special member of the broad notion called data. 
												
						Specifications of data elements, the basic units of data, involves documenting 
            relevant characteristics of each data element to ensure its representation of the natural world item is consistent 
            and accurate. <br><br>
            Data that has been carefully specified and standardized greatly enhances its  usefulness and share-ability 
            across systems and environments. Sharing data involves the ability to locate desired data, retrieve the data, 
            and to exchange the data with others. When data elements are well documented, and the documentation is 
            managed in a Data Element Registry, finding and retrieving them from disparate databases as well as sending 
            and receiving them via electronic communications are made easier.<br><br>
            Data Elements are the fundamental units of data an organization manages. When an organization needs to 
            transfer data to another organization, data elements are the fundamental units that make up the transaction 
            sets. <br><br>
            Data Elements are composed of three parts:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Object Class: a set of ideas, abstractions, or things in 
                the real world that can be identified with explicit boundaries and meaning and whose properties and 
                behavior follow the same rules.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Property:  is a peculiarity common to all members of an object class
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Representation:  describes how the data are represented, i.e. 
                the combination of a value domain, data type, and if necessary, a unit of measure or a character set.
              </li>
            </ul>
            The combination of an Object Class and a Property results in a Data Element Concept.  A Value Domain includes the Values
            and Value Meanings (i.e. Representation) of the Data Element. <br><br>
            In other words, a Data Element is the result of combining two Administered Components: a 
            Data Element Concept (the idea you are trying to represent) and a Value Domain 
            (how it should be represented).

            are collected. Administered Components include: Data Element Concept, Value Domain, Data Element,

						still maps to the mandatory and optional metadata items prescribed by ISO/IEC 11179, Part 3. 
						There are various levels of conformance for ISO/IEC 11179 compliance. Because of NCICB's business needs 
						related extensions, caDSR is considered “conforming” as opposed to 
						“strictly conforming” to the ISO/IEC 11179 Standard.

            A Data Element is formed by a concept that takes on a specific representation. 
						In ISO/IEC 11179 terms, this translates into the combination of a specific 
						Data Element Concept and a specific Value Domain. caDSR administered items 
						are backed by the use of externally defined terminologies and controlled vocabularies. 
						With UMLS as a framework, NCI has developed vocabulary services that 
						are accessed via API (application to application interfaces) to provide touch 
						points during creation of content. This results in administered components 
						that are bound to immutable concept codes. These touchpoints are currently implemented 
						at the Object Class, Property, Representation Term, Value Domain and 
						Valid Value levels of the metadata model.
