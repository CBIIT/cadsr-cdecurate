  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2>The ISO 11179 Standard describes a Data Element Concept as 
      the combination of an Object Class, a Property, and Qualifiers for each. 
      Definitions for each of these terms are documented below. </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2><SPAN class=figureText>What is a Data Element 
      Concept?</SPAN><BR>The ISO/IEC 11179 Standard describes a Data Element 
      Concept as relating several data elements that record data about that 
      concept with different representations. For example, a concept of 
      PatientPlaceOfBirth is a Data Element Concept.<BR><BR>A Data Element 
      Concept is composed of an Object Class, a Property and optional Qualifiers 
      for both. </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2><SPAN class=figureText>What is an Object 
      Class?</SPAN><BR>The ISO 11179 Standard describes an Object Class as ‘a 
      set of ideas, abstractions, or things in the real world that can be 
      identified with explicit boundaries and meaning and whose properties and 
      behavior follow the same rules’. In other words, Object Classes are the 
      ‘things about which you want to store and collect data.’ Examples of 
      Object Classes include cars, persons, households, employees, etc. For the 
      example of PatientPlaceOfBirth, an Object class is Patient. </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2><SPAN class=figureText>What is a Property?</SPAN><BR>The ISO 
      11179 Standard describes a Property as ‘a peculiarity common to all 
      members of an object class’. In other words, properties are ‘what humans 
      use to describe or distinguish Objects’. For the example given above, a 
      Property is PlaceOfBirth. </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2><SPAN class=figureText>What are Qualifiers?</SPAN><BR>The 
      ISO 11179 Standard describes qualifiers as being used to ‘differentiate 
      between names (i.e. Object Class and Property combinations) that would 
      otherwise be the same’. For the example of PatientPlaceOfBirth, a 
      Qualifier of year is used to indicate a specific year.<BR></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2><BR>Data Element Concepts are named by combining Primary and 
      Qualifier Concepts for Object Classes and Properties. The Object Classes 
      and Properties are then used for naming the Data Element Concept. This 
      approach is new for version 3.0 of the CDE Curation Tool. Building Blocks 
      for Object Classes and Properties<BR><BR>Object Classes and Properties are 
      the building blocks from which a Data Element Concept name is made. When 
      creating a new Data Element Concept the use of Object Classes and 
      Properties is strongly encouraged but not strictly mandatory. The CDE 
      Curation Tool enables you to search caDSR and the NCI EVS (Enterprise 
      Vocabulary Services) for for Concepts. The Primary Concepts may represent 
      existing Object Classes and Properties, or Concepts may be combined to 
      create new Object Classes and Properties. <SPAN class=figureText>Figure 
      4</SPAN> shows the interface to search for Concepts for Object Classes and 
      Properties. Object Class and Property Long Names are also created from 
      this interface.<BR><BR>An Object Class or Property may consist of one 
      Primary Concept and one or more Qualifier Concepts. Each of these Concepts 
      must be selected separately. Once selected the Concept's source database 
      and Concept Code will be shown below the Concept. You may highlight 
      Qualifier Concepts one at a time to see their source database and Concept 
      Code.<BR><BR>The Object Class and Property Long Names will be constructed 
      from the names of the Qualifier and Primary Concepts that have been 
      chosen. The Long Name will be built left to right starting with the 
      Concept at the top of the Qualifier Concepts list and ending with the 
      Primary Concept. Once you have built the Object Class and Property Long 
      Names they are not editable.<BR><BR>Please note that if you select only a 
      Primary Concept from the caDSR database and select no Qualifier Concepts 
      you have in effect selected an existing Object Class (or Property). In 
      this case, no new Object Class (or Property) will be created in caDSR when 
      you submit your Data Element Concept. </TD></TR>

    <TD colSpan=2>Searching for Building Blocks using the regular Term Search 
      is very similar to searching for any other Administered Component. The

      Class and Property) that will ultimately comprise the Data Element Concept

      The ISO 11179 Standard describes Conceptual Domain as ‘a set of all 
      possible, valid value meanings of a data element concept expressed without 
      representation’. Conceptual Domains are plural, object oriented, lacking 
      in representation, and may be associated with more than one Data Element 
      Concept. For the example given above with the Data Element Concept of 
      PatientPlaceOfBirth, a Conceptual Domain is Country.<BR><BR>When the
