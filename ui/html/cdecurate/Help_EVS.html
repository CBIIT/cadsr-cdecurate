  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2>A wealth of clinical and scientific and clinical research 
      data exists within the cancer research community. The NCI's Center for 
      Bioinformatics has developed an evolving core infrastructure designed to 
      provide the ability to seamlessly translate and interchange semantically 
      immutable information. The caCORE infrastructure provides researchers, 
      developers and statisticians with the ability to plug their existing data, 
      sources and methods into a standardized sharable framework that supports 
      information exchange, regardless of source, location or format. 
      <P>Different biomedical domains have their own terminologies and 
      ontological resources, each focused on different concepts within their 
      domain. A common terminology is the foundation for interoperability 
      between systems, indexing repositories of information, and querying and 
      integrating information sources across research areas. The Enterprise 
      Vocabulary Services (EVS) is a set of vocabulary resources that are being 
      used to provide a common terminology across the cancer research domain, 
      improving communication between the people, organizations, data and data 
      sources in it. 
      <P>NCICB's clinical trials informatics efforts draw on EVS whenever domain 
      terminology is required. This reliance on controlled vocabulary ensures 
      that term meanings remain clear and can be related to other terms with 
      similar concepts. 
      <P>The EVS Project is a collaborative effort of the Center for 
      Bioinformatics and the NCI Office of Communications. EVS includes 
      Distributed Terminology System (DTS) Vocabularies and the NCI 
      Metathesaurus. The DTS Vocabulary include:

    <TD class=subTopic1 colSpan=2>Search for Naming Components (NEW Tree 
      Search/Include, Qualifier Concepts, and Primary Concepts) </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Data Element Concepts are named by combining Primary and Qualifier 
      Concepts for Object Classes and Properties. Value Domains are named by 
      combining Primary and Qualifier Concepts for Representation Term. These 
      are then used for naming the Data Element Concept and Value Domain. This 
      approach is new for version 3.0 of the CDE Curation Tool.<BR><BR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2><B>Naming a Data Element Concept</B> </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Object Classes and Properties are the building blocks from which a 
      Data Element Concept name is made. When creating a new Data Element 
      Concept the use of Object Classes and Properties is strongly encouraged 
      but not strictly mandatory. The CDE Curation Tool enables you to search 
      caDSR and the NCI EVS (Enterprise Vocabulary Services) for for Concepts. 
      The Primary Concepts may represent existing Object Classes and Properties, 
      or Concepts may be combined to create new Object Classes and Properties. 
      Object Class and Property Long Names are also created from this 
      interface.<BR><BR>An Object Class or Property may consist of one Primary 
      Concept and one or more Qualifier Concepts. Each of these Concepts must be 
      selected separately. Once selected the Concept's source database and 
      Concept Code will be shown below the Concept. You may highlight Qualifier 
      Concepts one at a time to see their source database and Concept 
      Code.<BR><BR>The Object Class and Property Long Names will be constructed 
      from the names of the Qualifier and Primary Concepts that have been 
      chosen. The Long Name will be built left to right starting with the 
      Concept at the top of the Qualifier Concepts list and ending with the 
      Primary Concept. Once you have built the Object Class and Property Long 
      Names they are not editable.<BR><BR>Please note that if you select only a 
      Primary Concept from the caDSR database and select no Qualifier Concepts 
      you have in effect selected an existing Object Class (or Property). In 
      this case, no new Object Class (or Property) will be created in caDSR when 
      you submit your Data Element Concept.<BR><BR></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2><B>Naming a Value Domain</B> </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Representation Term is the building block from which a Value Domain 
      name is made. When creating a new Value Domain, the use of a 
      Representation Term is strongly encouraged but not strictly mandatory. The 
      CDE Curation Tool enables you to search caDSR and the NCI EVS (Enterprise 
      Vocabulary Services) for for Concepts. The Primary Concepts may represent 
      existing Representation Terms, or Concepts may be combined to create a new 
      Representation Term. The Representation Term Long Name is also created 
      from this interface.<BR><BR>A Representation Term may consist of one 
      Primary Concept and one or more Qualifier Concepts. Each of these must be 
      selected separately. Once selected the Concept's source database and 
      Concept Code will be shown below the Concept. You may highlight Qualifier 
      Concepts one at a time to see their source database and Concept 
      Code.<BR><BR>The Representation Term Long Names will be constructed from 
      the names of the Qualifier and Primary Concepts that have been chosen. The 
      Long Name will be built left to right starting with the Object Class and 
      ending with the Primary Concept. Once you have built the Representation 
      Term Long Name, it is not editable. Optionally, a user may choose to 
      search for Object Class and Properties to assist in the creation of a 
      Value Domain's Long Name.<BR><BR>Please note that if you select only a 
      Primary Concept from the caDSR database and select no Qualifier Concepts 
      you have in effect selected an existing Representation Term. In this case, 
      no new Representation Term will be created in caDSR when you submit your 
      Value Domain. </TD></TR>

      Building Blocks (Primary and Qualifier Concepts) via Term Search </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2>Searching for Building Blocks using the regular Term Search 
      is very similar to searching for any other Administered Component. The 
      first step is to search for and choose the optional building blocks 
      (Primary and Qualifier Concepts) that will ultimately comprise the 
      Administered Component Long Name.<BR><BR>As a new fewature for version 3.0 
      you may restrict your search to exclude Retired Concepts, or you may 
      include all Concepts in your search.<BR></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2>Once you have entered your search term and started your 
      search, the Search Results screen will appear to the right of the search 
      criteria. Next to each concept that is returned is a check box. In order 
      to use a term that you have identified, check the box next to it, then 
      click the ‘Use Selection’ button at the top of the screen. </TD></TR><!-- ***** SECTION BREAK ***** -->

  <TR>
    <TD colSpan=2>You may also search for Concepts in the NCI Thesaurus 
      portion of EVS using a tree-based seach that is new for version 3.0. To 
      access the tree-based search click on the ‘Tree Search’ hyperlink in the 
      ‘Search In:’ section of the search screen. <SPAN class=figureText>Figure

      <P>When the Tree Search first appears all of the NCI Thesaurus Root 
      Concepts will appear on the left side of the screen. Each Root Concept may 
      have one or more Subconcepts. A Concept's Subconcepts may be seen by 
      clicking on the plus sign next to the Concept name. Some Subconcepts will 
      have Subconcepts of their own which may be seen by clicking on a plus sign 
      that appears next to the Subconcept name. If no plus sign appears then the 
      Subconcept has no Subconcepts of its own.<BR><BR>To select a Root Concept 
      or Subconcept, click on its name. The Concept's details will appear in the 
      Search Results window to the right. The Concept may appear more than once 
      if it has multiple definitions. There will be one row for each definition. 
      If no definition is associated with the Concept, the definition field will 
      read ‘No Value Exists.’<BR><BR>Once Concepts appear in the Search Results 
      area, one may be selected by clicking on the check box next to its Concept 
      Name. When a Concept is selected in this way several options are enabled. 
      The Concept may be used for your Data Element Concept by clicking on the 
      ‘Use Selection’ button above the search results. A Concept's Subconcepts 
      may be retrieved to the Search Results area by clicking on one of the 
      selections from the ‘Get Subconcepts’ button. You may get only the 
      immediate Subconcepts or all Subconcepts regardless of how far down the 
      tree they may be. A third option is to retrieve all of the selected 
      Concept's Superconcepts by clicking on the ‘Get Superconcepts’ button.
