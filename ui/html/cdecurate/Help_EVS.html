			A wealth of clinical and scientific and clinical research data exists 
			within the cancer research community. The NCI's Center for Bioinformatics 
			has developed an evolving core infrastructure designed to provide  
			the ability to seamlessly translate and interchange semantically 
			immutable information. The caCORE infrastructure provides researchers, 
			developers and statisticians with the ability to plug their existing data, 
			sources and methods into a standardized sharable framework that supports 
			information exchange, regardless of source, location or format. 
			<p>
  		Different biomedical domains have their own terminologies and ontological 
			resources, each focused on different concepts within their domain. 
			A common terminology is the foundation for interoperability between 
			systems, indexing repositories of information, and querying and 
			integrating information sources across research areas. The Enterprise 
			Vocabulary Services (EVS) is a set of vocabulary resources that are 
			being used to provide a common terminology across the cancer research 
			domain, improving communication between the people, organizations, 
			data and data sources in it. 
			<p>
			NCICB's clinical trials informatics 
			efforts draw on EVS whenever domain terminology is required. This 
			reliance on controlled vocabulary ensures that term meanings remain 
			clear and can be related to other terms with similar concepts. 
			<p>
			The EVS Project is a collaborative effort of the Center for 
			Bioinformatics and the NCI Office of Communications. EVS includes 
			Distributed Terminology System (DTS) Vocabularies and the NCI 
			Metathesaurus. The DTS Vocabulary include:

            knowledgebase contains the working vocabulary used in NCI 
            data systems. It covers clinical, translational and basic 
            research as well as administrative terminology.

          </li>
        </ul>
        The EVS Project also produces the NCI Metathesaurus, which is 
        based on NLM's Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus 
        supplemented with additional cancer-centric vocabulary. The public 
				version of NCI Metathesaurus currently contains all public domain 
				vocabularies from the National Library of Medicine's UMLS Metathesaurus, 
				as well as a growing number of NCI-specific vocabularies 
				developed by the National Cancer Institute.

<br><br>
        In the CDE Curation Tool, the EVS Vocabularies can be searched for primary and qualifier concepts 
				that can be used to create both the names and definitions for   
        Object Class, Property, and Representation Terms. These are the building blocks for 
				Data Element Concepts and Value Domains. EVS Vocabularies are also 
				searched when crating Permissible Values and Value Meanings as well as
				when creating the defitions for any of the administered items 
				listed above, plus Data Elements.

            Object Classes and Properties are the building

						enables you to search caDSR and the NCI EVS (Enterprise Vocabulary Services) for
						for Concepts. The Primary Concepts may represent existing Object Classes 
						and Properties, or Concepts may be combined to create new Object Classes and
						Properties. Object Class and Property Long Names are also created from this interface.<br>
						<br>
						An Object Class or Property may consist of one Primary Concept and one
						or more Qualifier Concepts. Each of these Concepts must be selected
						separately. Once selected the Concept's source database and Concept Code will
						be shown below the Concept. You may highlight Qualifier Concepts one at a 
						time to see their source database and Concept Code.<br>
						<br>
						The Object Class and Property Long Names will be constructed
						from the names of the Qualifier and Primary Concepts that have been
						chosen. The Long Name will be built left to right starting with the Concept
						at the top of the Qualifier Concepts list and ending with the Primary
						Concept. Once you have built the Object Class and Property Long Names they
						are not editable.<br>
						<br>
						Please note that if you select only a Primary Concept from the caDSR database
						and select no Qualifier Concepts you have in effect selected an existing
						Object Class (or Property). In this case, no new Object Class (or Property)
						will be created in caDSR when you submit your Data Element Concept.<br><br>
