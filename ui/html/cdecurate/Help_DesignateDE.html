            Before you go to the trouble of creating a new Data Element
            in your Context, you may choose to Designate an existing Data Element 
            instead. Designating simply means that you will ‘point’ the existing 
            Data Element (including all of its attributes) to your Context.  
            In other words, the designated Data Element will now be ‘Used By’ your Context.
            A complete listing of Designation rules can be found on the 
            <a href="http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/core/caDSR/BusinessRules/#Designations" target="blank"> 
            NCI Center for Bioinformatics</a> Business Rules page.
            <br><br>
            <span class="red"><b>NOTE:  </b></span>
            Only Data Elements may be designated; and only those having the following 
            workflow statuses:  APPRVD FOR TRIAL USE, CMTE APPROVED, 
            CMTE SUBMTD USED, DRAFT MOD, RELEASED, OR RELEASED-NON-CMPLNT.
            <br><br>
            <span class="red"><b>NOTE: </b></span>
            If you Designate a Data Element to your Context, you will have write
            privileges for only a few attributes for that Data Element in its 
            current version. All other changes to the Data Element will be the 
            responsibility of the "owning" context. This is usually the context 
            for which the Data Element was originally created.

            To designate a Data Element(s) using the CDE Curation Tool first, use the 
            <a href="Help_SearchAC.html#searchForAC" target="Help_SearchAC">Search</a> 
            feature to locate the Data Element(s) that you would like to 
            designate. Select the desired Data Element(s) from the search results by clicking
						on the box next to the Data Element's name. Then click the ‘Designations’ 
						action button at the top of the main search screen. This will open the
						Designations screen. When you open the Designations screen all the currently 
						designated items will appear in the appropriate fields. Figure 1 
						illustrates where to find the Designations button.

            The first step for creating Designations or any other "used by" 
            attributes is to select a Designation Context.  This is done by 
            selecting a Context from the first drop down list.  The Contexts in 
            the drop down list vary from user to user depending on the Context(s)
						for which they have permissions. Figure 4 shows how to  select the
						"used by" Context for the Designated Data Element.
