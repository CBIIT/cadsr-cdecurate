This zipfile contains the files and images for the proposed User-Interface for the ability to Edit a Value Meaning (VM) in the CDE Curation Tool v3.2.1. There are 4 UIs one for Editing a VM with Concepts (CDE_Curation_Edit_VM.htm) and its Validation page (Validate_VM.htm) and another for Editing a VM without concepts (CDE_Curation_Edit_VM_No_Concepts.htm) and its validation page (Validate_VM_No_Concepts.htm). Please note that these UIs are not fully-functional; however they provide a visual for how Editing a VM could occur in the Curation Tool. The current working functionality includes the Validate buttons at the top of both the CDE_Curation_Edit_VM.htm and CDE_Curation_Edit_VM_No_Concepts.htm. Please note that underlined items, icons and buttons will be working links/actions in the released version of the Curation Tool.
