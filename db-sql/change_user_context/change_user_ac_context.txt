*** REQUIREMENTS ***
From: "Warzel, Denise (NIH/NCI)
Date: 05/22/2013 1:13 AM (GMT-05:00) 

Dianne says this will be needed again, so please proceed with the script as we discussed.

I created some test content on Dev.

Move content created by dwarzel in NIDA Context to NHLBI Context.
Also we need to be able to specify a date created equal to or greater than a specified data 
(date range would be great, but if too much loe, equal to or greater than would be fine)


E.g. Date created is equal to or greater than (after) 05-22-2013.  So items with date 05-22-2013 and 05-23-2013 
would match, but 05-21-2013 would not match – it this becomes too big LOE, we will just go with equal to and 
run it multiple times for all the dates the curator created content ... 

This should result in changes on DEV to: 

1 DEC 3636041
2 CDEs 3636046, 3636047
1 Enumerated VD 3636043

And nothing else.
